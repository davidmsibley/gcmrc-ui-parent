The Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC) in partnership with the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) have designed and built a database and web application for serving, and operating on, time-series measurements of key water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration values. This web application is currently called the Discharge, Sediment, and Water Quality Monitoring web application, or GCMRC web application. A live implementation can be seen online at: http://www.gcmrc.gov/discharge_qw_sediment/

This web-based set of tools and processes continually aggregate, compute and display data of interest to resource managers and decision makers in support of the Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Program.
